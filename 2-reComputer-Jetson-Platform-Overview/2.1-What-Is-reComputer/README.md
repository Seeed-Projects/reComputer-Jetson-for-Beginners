The reComputer J4012 edge device is composed with one reComputer J401 carrier board, one Jetson Orin NX 16GB module, one heatsink with fan, and one aluminum enclosure:

### - Jetson Orin NX Module

The NVIDIA¬Æ Jetson Orin‚Ñ¢ NX delivers AI supercomputer performance in a compact system-on-module (SOM) smaller than a credit card. Powered by a low-power NVIDIA Orin SoC, it combines the NVIDIA Ampere‚Ñ¢ GPU architecture with advanced 64-bit processing, multi-function video and image capabilities, and Deep Learning Accelerators. 

With up to 100 INT8 TOPs for compute and 50 INT8 TOPs for deep learning, it supports running multiple neural networks and processing high-resolution sensor data simultaneously. The Jetson Orin NX offers a blend of performance and power efficiency with diverse I/Os, including high-speed CSI and PCIe, as well as low-speed I2Cs and GPIOs, ideal for embedded and edge computing devices where size, weight, and power are critical.


### - reComputer J401 Carrier Board

The reComputer J401 carrier board is an advanced, open-source extension board for NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano/ Orin Nano modules. It breaks out typical IO interfaces from the SoM, inlcuding 4x USB 3.2, HDMI 2.1, 2x CSI, 1x RJ45 for GbE, M.2 Key E for WiFi/BLE connection, M.2 Key M for storage expansion, CAN, and GPIO, Pre-installed JetPack 5.1.1 on 128GB NVMe SSD, and also supporting the latest JetPack 6 BSP , all for accelarating your solution to market in ease.
